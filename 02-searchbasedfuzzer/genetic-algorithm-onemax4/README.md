Like previous version, but with different selection mechanism.
Slightly based on https://deap.readthedocs.io/en/master/examples/ga_onemax.html.

My implementation is still bad / I'm still doing something wrong.
Example output:

```
$ cargo run
...
Generation  991: Best Fitness = 109
Generation  992: Best Fitness = 115
Generation  993: Best Fitness = 115
Generation  994: Best Fitness = 106
Generation  995: Best Fitness = 113
Generation  996: Best Fitness = 114
Generation  997: Best Fitness = 122
Generation  998: Best Fitness = 118
Generation  999: Best Fitness = 118
