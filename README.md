Some notes and experiments while working through parts of [The Fuzzing Book](https://www.fuzzingbook.org)[^1] (unaffiliated); mainly for myself for learning about the topic and trying things out.
The content is organized by chapters/sections and then simply numbered increasingly.
For educational purposes only.
